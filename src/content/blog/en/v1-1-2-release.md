Today I released version **1.1.2** of my portfolio. Here are the main new features:

## 📧 New Professional Identity
I migrated my contacts to a custom domain. Now all communications go through `info@leonardocastignani.it`, managed via a secure server and connected to Gmail for maximum efficiency.

## 🚀 SEO Optimization
I've been working "under the hood" to improve search engine visibility:
*   Automatic generation of **XML Sitemap**.
*   Configuring **Robots.txt**.
*   Enrichment of translation files (IT/EN) with strategic keywords for the Marche region.

## 🐛 Bug Fix
*   Fixed a critical issue with script loading that caused content to be invisible in some browsers.
*   Restored and animated the "Back to Top" button.
*   Improved the style of the Contacts section with a more appealing title.

*The site is constantly evolving. See you in the next update!*
